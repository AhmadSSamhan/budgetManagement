# budgetManagement

The App uses a set of Android Jetpack libraries plus Retrofit to dispay data from REST API(Unsplash)
and handle app pages with Room database using navigation components. The App written by Kotlin language.

### Prerequisites

The project has all required dependencies in the gradle files. Add the Project to Android Studio or
Intelij and build.All the required dependencies will be downloaded and installed.

## Architecture
The project uses MVVM architecture pattern.
• Code Language: Kotlin.
• Using Hilt techniques.
• Binding view.
• Android Jetpack Components(ViewModel, Navigation Component ..etc).
• Room database.
• Kotlin coroutines.
• Kotlin flow.
• Clean Architecture.

## Feature

• Support 2 languages: Arabic/English.
• Support dark theme.
• Support light theme.
• Using friendly user interface.

## Libraries

* [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel/) - Manage UI
  related data in a lifecycle conscious way and act as a channel between use cases and ui
* [DataBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding) - support library that
  allows binding of UI components in layouts to data sources,binds character details and search
  results to UI
* [Navigation Component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-getting-started)
  - Android Jetpack's Navigation component helps in implementing navigation between fragments
* [Hilt]([https://dagger.dev/dev-guide/](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android)) - Dependency injection with Hilt.
* [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - To access the Rest Api
* [Kotlin Flow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow) - To access data sequentially
* [Encrypted SharedPreferences](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/security/crypto/EncryptedSharedPreferences) -An implementation of SharedPreferences that encrypts keys and values
* [Room components](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) - Save data in a local database using Room.
* [Kotlin components Coroutine](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/coroutines) - Use Kotlin coroutines with lifecycle-aware components
* [Lifecycle components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/lifecycle) -Handling Lifecycles with Lifecycle-Aware Components 
* [SSP]- To Support muitl screen density.
